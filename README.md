# Data Structures in C++ and Python

This is a mini project done as a practice exercise to test my comprehension between datastructures and pointers in C++.
I also implement the same datastructures in Python to confirm that the general idea of the datastructures are indeed learned and not just by syntax memory.

Here is a list of the datastructures found in this project:
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
